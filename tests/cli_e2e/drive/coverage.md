# Drive CLI E2E Coverage

## Metrics
- Denominator: 31 leaf commands
- Covered: 10
- Coverage: 32.3%

## Summary
- TestDrive_FilesCreateFolderWorkflow: proves `drive files create_folder` in `create_folder as bot`; helper asserts the returned folder token and registers best-effort cleanup via `drive files delete`.
- TestDrive_StatusWorkflow: proves `drive +status` against a real Drive folder. Seeds the remote side via `drive +upload` (`unchanged.txt`, `modified.txt`, `remote-only.txt`), seeds local files with the matching/diverging contents, and asserts every output bucket (`unchanged`, `modified`, `new_local`, `new_remote`) holds exactly the expected `rel_path` and `file_token`. Cleans up uploaded files and the parent folder via best-effort cleanup hooks.
- TestDrive_UploadWorkflow: proves `drive +upload` against the real backend in both create and overwrite modes. First uploads a fresh file into a temporary Drive folder, then re-uploads new bytes with `--file-token` against the returned token, asserts the overwrite keeps the token stable, and finally downloads the file to confirm the remote content changed.
- TestDrive_DuplicateRemoteWorkflow: proves the duplicate-remote workflows against the real backend. One subtest uploads two same-name files into the same Drive folder and asserts `drive +status` and default `drive +pull` both fail with a typed validation error for the duplicate rel_path, while `drive +pull --on-duplicate-remote=rename` succeeds, downloads both files, and writes a hashed renamed sibling locally. The other subtest uploads duplicate remote files, runs `drive +push --on-duplicate-remote=newest --if-exists=overwrite --delete-remote --yes`, and then re-runs `drive +status` to prove the mirror converged to a single unchanged `dup.txt`.
- TestDrive_ApplyPermissionDryRun / TestDrive_ApplyPermissionDryRunRejectsFullAccess: dry-run coverage for `drive +apply-permission`; asserts URL→type inference for docx/sheet/slides, explicit `--type` overriding URL inference when both a recognized URL and `--type` are supplied, bare-token + explicit `--type` path, request method/URL/type-query/perm/remark body shape, optional `remark` omission when unset, and client-side rejection of `--perm full_access`. Runs without hitting the live API.
- TestDriveAddCommentDryRun_File / TestDriveAddCommentDryRun_Base: dry-run coverage for `drive +add-comment` on supported Drive file and Base targets; pins the `metas.batch_query -> files/:token/new_comments` file chain, Base `file_type=bitable`, and Base anchor fields.
- TestDriveAddCommentMarkdownFileWorkflow: opt-in live workflow skeleton for the same path, gated by `LARK_DRIVE_MD_COMMENT_E2E=1`.
- TestDrive_SecureLabelDryRun: dry-run coverage for `drive +secure-label-list` and `drive +secure-label-update`; asserts label-list query params and update URL→type inference, request method/URL/type query, and `label-id` body shape. Runs without hitting live APIs because update can trigger document-level security approval flows.
- TestDriveExportDryRun_FileNameMetadata / TestDriveExportDryRun_MarkdownFetchAPI / TestDriveExportDryRun_BitableBaseOnlySchema: dry-run coverage for `drive +export`; asserts export task request shape, markdown fetch request shape without docs fetch `extra_param`, local `--file-name` / `--output-dir` metadata, and `bitable` `.base` `only_schema` request body without calling live APIs.
- TestDrive_PullDryRun / TestDrive_PullDryRunAcceptsDuplicateRemoteStrategies: dry-run coverage for `drive +pull`; asserts the list-files request shape, Validate-stage safety guards, and acceptance of `--on-duplicate-remote=rename|newest|oldest` by the real CLI binary.
- TestDrive_PushDryRun / TestDrive_PushDryRunAcceptsDuplicateRemoteStrategies: dry-run coverage for `drive +push`; asserts the list-files request shape, Validate-stage safety guards, conditional delete preflight, and acceptance of `--on-duplicate-remote=newest|oldest` by the real CLI binary.
- Cleanup note: `drive files delete` is only exercised in cleanup and is intentionally left uncovered.
- Blocked area: live export, permission, subscription, reply, and file comment API flows still need deterministic remote fixtures and filesystem setup.
- Dry-run note: `drive_upload_dryrun_test.go::TestDriveUploadDryRun_WikiTarget` and `TestDriveUploadDryRun_WithFileToken` cover the wiki-target and overwrite request shapes for `drive +upload`; live upload/status/duplicate workflows also use real `+upload` against the backend.

## Command Table

| Status | Cmd | Type | Testcase | Key parameter shapes | Notes / uncovered reason |
